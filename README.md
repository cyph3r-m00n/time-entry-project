Time Tracking Application.
***************************************
Purpose

The purpose of this application is to have an interface that asks me questions on the data
That I want to store, and stores it on a page designated for the day. 

Can be used by multiple people, by means of a login, and it stores the information for
them on a link that separates all of the entries by day. 

Things that would be needed. 


1. Server(node) to be able to communicate with the DB and serve the pages. 
2. DB connection
3. authentication.
4. Routes
5. links to day pages
